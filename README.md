# Iris

Practicing Data Analysis with Python as practice. 
Using geeks4geeks "Exploratory Data Analysis on Iris Dataset" cuz apparently its the 
"hello world" of data analysis. 

I went slightly off what they did as lots of their methods are depreciated in modern day libraries. I also made it an OOP project as I didnt want to shove everything on the same file. Too messy in my opinion. My visualise_heatmap function is broken and returns a valueerror but i got no clue why so im leaving it for future me.
Was a fun intro to data with python!
